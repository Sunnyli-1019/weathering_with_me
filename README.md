Description:
A web application project implemented in frontend React framework and backend Nodejs, with MongoDB database. Using WeatherAPI.com as data source, users can view weather information in a table or map view, and search locations using keywords. A separate view is used to show weather details of individual location, a map displaying geographic location and othersâ€™ comments. Locations can be added to the user's favorite list for easy access. Moreover, Admin can perform the CRUD operations to the stored location and user data, and request updated data.
